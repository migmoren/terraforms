# Portfolio Infrastructure Practice

Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This project is part of my ongoing journey to expand my experience as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer. Here, I am building and managing cloud infrastructure using Terraform, deploying applications with automation, and integrating various technologies to practice and test them together in real-world scenarios.

The main goal of this repository is to document and showcase my hands-on work with infrastructure as code (IaC), cloud services (AWS), and application deployment. By working on this portfolio, I aim to:

- **Expand my technical skills** by experimenting with new tools and services.
- **Follow best practices** in infrastructure automation, security, and scalability.
- **Test and integrate** different technologies to understand how they work together in a production-like environment.
- **Share knowledge with friends, partners and collaborators.

Feel free to explore the code and resources. I will continue to update this repository as I learn and implement more features and technologies.
